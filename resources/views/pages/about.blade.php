                    I have a deep passion in programming and I am craving for new knowledge about it. I always getting excited whenever I learned new things whether it's a tool/plugins that would make my work easily or a new programming language, coding structure and a framework which will be added in my skillset. I even watch tutorials and read documentations about programming in some of my free time. I am currently looking for a job in Singapore as a Web Developer.
